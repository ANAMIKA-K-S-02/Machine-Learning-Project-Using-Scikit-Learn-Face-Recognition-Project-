||Hands-on Machine Learning Project Using Scikit-Learn: Face Recognition Project with Python.👩‍💻|| 

Face recognition is a powerful application of Machine Learning and Computer Vision, widely used in security systems, authentication, and image analysis. In this project, I implemented a Face Recognition Model using:

🔸 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
🔸 Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification
🔸 Confusion Matrix & Accuracy Metrics for model evaluation

Here used the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, which contains real-world images of famous personalities. The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify faces into predefined categories.

 Key Aspects of the Project:
🔰 Dataset: LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)
Extracted images of people with at least 50 instances
Converted images into grayscale and flattened pixel data
🔰 Preprocessing & Feature Extraction
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) used to extract 150 key features
Whitening applied to normalize data
🔰 Model Training: SVM with RBF Kernel
Used Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to optimize performance
🔰 Model Evaluation: Confusion Matrix & Accuracy
Evaluated predictions using a confusion matrix
Computed accuracy score & classification report
🔰 Visualization of Predictions
Displayed predicted labels on test images
